## 5. Error Details

No errors found in testing.
## 6. Conclusions and Recommendations
- Prioritize fixing critical functionalities that failed during test execution.
- Investigate and fix recurring errors in table generation or filters identified in multiple test cases.
- Perform performance analysis on functionalities that showed longer execution times or slowness.
- Strengthen automated test coverage in areas with a history of failures to reduce future regressions.
- Establish a routine for reviewing and monitoring test results to identify trends and prevent recurring issues.
